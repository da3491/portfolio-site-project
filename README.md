Specifications

1. Access all the portfolio webpage's content just by scrolling.

2. Click different buttons that will take me to the portfolio creator's different social media pages.

3. Thumbnail images of different projects the portfolio creator has built (if you haven't built any websites before, use https://picsum.photos/ as stylish placeholders.)

4. Navigate to different sections of the webpage by clicking buttons in the navigation.

5. A link to https://www.altcademy.com on your website, makes most sense to put it at the footer. The text can be something like "Part of Altcademy's Fullstack Program".
